- remove more duplicate code with concepts
- more memcpy for trivially copyable types
- constexpr
- noexcept
- stack allocator
- verify container allocators after copy, move ctor and copy, move assignment
- document container allocator behavior on copy, move
- natvis et al.
  - Debug views that actually work on linux, natvis seems to be VS only still
  - How to implement without making implementation messier and more bugprone?
